This time instead of just cleaning up one of our Activities you should decide on a way to extend the idea. Please choose one of the extensions below and complete a program that implements it - these are all extnesions of activities or homework we have done so follow the same guidelines.\n","\n","To achieve a 4 or a 5 you will need to include comments explaining what the steps are doing. I am purposefully leaving these open ended, you can discuss your ideas with me!\n","\n","**Continued Fractions:**  You wrote a function that takes a list and computes the continued fraction using those values. Write a function that goes in the other direction:  It takes a float x and produces the sequences of $\\[ a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots \\]$ so that \n","\n","$$ x \\approx a_0 + \\frac{1}{a_1 + \\frac{1}{a_2 + \\dots }} $$\n","\n","*Note that lists in Python must be finite, so you will need to make a deicision aobut how far out to computer this result*\n","\n","**Codes:** We implemented the Caesar Cypher, but saw that it was not a very sophistacated code and in fact using Python is trivial to break. Find a variation of the Caesar Cypher that is more secure and implement it. If you want to talk about an idea, see me.\n","\n","**Sorting:** You can look up sorting algorithms on wikipedia. Write functions implementing some other sorting algorithms. To achieve a 4 on this one you should implement multiple sorting algorithms so you can compare them with each other.\n","\n","**Analyzing Hamlet:** Count the frequency of words in Hamlet. Give a list of the 10 most common words. *Note that you probably want to use a dictionary to implement this*.\n","\n","Your solution may use dictionaries, sets, and tuples if they are useful, but other than *Analyzing Hamlet* they would not be necessary.\n"],"id":"70e2b5af-6c95-4575-9ea8-54e548725eb6"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5b7d1fb5-38b1-40bc-a9ba-f2939c49b84d"},"source":[""],"id":"5b7d1fb5-38b1-40bc-a9ba-f2939c49b84d","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
