If it is built around one of the activities, homeworks, or other projects you should be sure to extend the idea further than we took it.\n","\n","Some ideas (just riffing):\n","\n","- Quaternion Numbers are a generalization of Complex Numbers. Write a package for doing arithemetic with them or taking square roots of them.\n","- Sudoku: write a package for reading and writing sudoku puzzles from a text file and solving them.\n","- Grade Book: write a package for reading and writing, and entering students grades for class assignments.\n","- Check Book: write a package for keeping track of expenses and deposits, and balancing a checking account.\n","- Polynomial Arithmetic and Calculus: write a package for doing arithemetic and calculus with polynomial functions.\n","\n","## Submission\n","\n","1. You will submit the .py, .ipynb, and any .txt files that are part of running your project and demonstrating what it does.\n","\n","2. The final exam will be:  With Google Colab or Jupyter and the files from your project you will answer some questions explaining your project, the design decisions you made, and how and why it works. In particular, be ready to discuss why you used the variable types you choose, and what the functions you use do.  You also should be able to discuss what additions or extensions might be next for your project.\n","\n","3. You will also make a short video explaining what your program does to the rest of the class."],"id":"f1e3ab7d-e345-4b92-8264-95b3533d6211"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"d56dd942-07f4-4697-a007-b6d8cee8169f"},"source":[""],"id":"d56dd942-07f4-4697-a007-b6d8cee8169f","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
