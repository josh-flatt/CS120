Remember it is online.\n","\n","## Question 1:\n","\n","Do the second exercise from the Activity 2:  Write a odd_factorial function that given an positive odd integer, computes the product of that number and all of the smaller positive odd integers. The mathematical notation for this is the *double factorial* (2N-1)!!.\n","\n","\n","## Question 2: \n","\n","The pairing problem is the following:  We have 2N students in the class, and the teacher wants to form them in to pairs for an assignment. The number of pairs is given by (2N-1)!!.\n","\n","What should the answer be if the class has an odd number of students?\n","\n","Write a function that takes the number of students in the class and returns the number of pairs the teacher can form if the input is odd; and the answer you decided on above if the input is even.\n","\n","## Quesiton 3:\n","\n","If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to form them into a triangle. The test is if any of the three sticks is longer than the sum of the lengths of the other two then you cannot form a triangle.\n","\n","Write a function that takes the lengths of the three sticks and produces an output indicating whether we can form a triangle with them or not.\n"],"id":"a7226225-51fe-406c-aa3f-9b7a98bcff11"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"790d0218-7300-4747-93e5-9b39abd0c061","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633029321210,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":137,"user":{"displayName":"Josh F","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiUOz3VVuU_koL47-503ev7R3n95TFevW2aqj8oiw=s64","userId":"01996511859194691009"}}},"source":["##Question 1\n","def odd_factorial(n):\n","  if n % 2 ==0:\n","    print(\"n must be an odd number.\")\n","    return None\n","  elif n ==1:\n","    return (n)\n","  else:\n","    return (n*odd_factorial(n-2))"],"id":"790d0218-7300-4747-93e5-9b39abd0c061","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"08RbtW5r9xt9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633029324124,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":116,"user":{"displayName":"Josh F","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiUOz3VVuU_koL47-503ev7R3n95TFevW2aqj8oiw=s64","userId":"01996511859194691009"}}},"source":["##Question 2\n","def odd_factorial(n):\n","  if n % 2 ==0:\n","    print(\"One student will be left out, since there\")\n","    print(\"is an odd number of students.\")\n","    return(n*odd_factorial(n-1))\n","  elif n==1:\n","    return (n)\n","  else:\n","    return (n*odd_factorial(n-2))"],"id":"08RbtW5r9xt9","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1I4aQ4iLHnNw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633029328349,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":106,"user":{"displayName":"Josh F","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiUOz3VVuU_koL47-503ev7R3n95TFevW2aqj8oiw=s64","userId":"01996511859194691009"}}},"source":["##Question 3\n","def triangle(a,b,c):\n","  if (a+b>c):\n","    if (a+c<b):\n","      print(\"no stick triangle\")\n","    elif (b+c<a):\n","      print(\"no stick triangle\")\n","    else:\n","      print(\"stick triangle\")\n","  else:\n","    print(\"no stick triangle\")"],"id":"1I4aQ4iLHnNw","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"E6cGKWgrIhc8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633029368116,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":106,"user":{"displayName":"Josh F","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiUOz3VVuU_koL47-503ev7R3n95TFevW2aqj8oiw=s64","userId":"01996511859194691009"}},"outputId":"63e452a2-8660-481b-bdba-06fb3f985ab2"},"source":["triangle(500,4,3)"],"id":"E6cGKWgrIhc8","execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["no stick triangle\n"]}]}]}
