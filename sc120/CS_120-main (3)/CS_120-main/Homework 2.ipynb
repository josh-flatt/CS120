    "Do the second exercise from the Activity 2:  Write a odd_factorial function that given an positive odd integer, computes the product of that number and all of the smaller positive odd integers. The mathematical notation for this is the *double factorial* (2N-1)!!.\n",

    "The pairing problem is the following:  We have 2N students in the class, and the teacher wants to form them in to pairs for an assignment. The number of pairs is given by (2N-1)!!.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should the answer be if the class has an odd number of students?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes the number of students in the class and returns the number of pairs the teacher can form if the input is odd; and the answer you decided on above if the input is even.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to form them into a triangle. The test is if any of the three sticks is longer than the sum of the lengths of the other two then you cannot form a triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes the lengths of the three sticks and produces an output indicating whether we can form a triangle with them or not.\n"
